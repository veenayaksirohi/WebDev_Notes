# 22. Modern CSS Layout Features (2025) üöÄ

CSS is evolving rapidly, and new features are being adopted by browsers at an unprecedented pace. This chapter explores the most exciting and transformative layout features landing in CSS in 2025 and beyond, including **native CSS nesting**, **container queries**, **subgrid**, and **cascade layers**. These tools enable more modular, maintainable, and powerful layouts than ever before.

## CSS Nesting (Native)

Native CSS nesting allows you to nest selectors inside one another, similar to what preprocessors like Sass have offered for years. This makes your CSS more readable and modular.

- **Syntax:**
```css
.card {
  padding: 1rem;
  background: #fff;
  border-radius: 8px;
  
  & h2 {
    margin-top: 0;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
  
  &:hover {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  }
}
```
- The `&` symbol refers to the parent selector.
- You can nest as deeply as you like, but keep it readable!

> [!info] **Browser Support**
> As of 2025, all major browsers support native CSS nesting. No build step required!

## Container Queries

Container queries allow you to apply styles to an element based on the size of its container, not just the viewport. This is a game-changer for truly modular, component-based design.

- **Syntax:**
```css
.card {
  container-type: inline-size;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 400px;
}

@container (min-width: 300px) {
  .card {
    background: #e3f2fd;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
}
```
- The `container-type` property enables a container for queries.
- The `@container` at-rule works like `@media`, but for the container's size.

**Example: Responsive Card Component**
```html
<!-- preview: true -->
<div class="card">
  <h2>Card Title</h2>
  <p>This card changes style based on its container's width, not the viewport!</p>
</div>
<style>
.card {
  container-type: inline-size;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 400px;
  background: #fff;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
  transition: background 0.3s;
}
@container (min-width: 300px) {
  .card {
    background: #e3f2fd;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
}
</style>
```

> [!tip] **Component-Driven Design**
> Container queries make it possible to build truly reusable components that adapt to their context, not just the viewport.

## CSS Subgrid

Subgrid allows a nested grid to inherit the row and/or column definitions of its parent grid. This makes it much easier to align items across complex layouts.

- **Syntax:**
```css
.parent-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  gap: 16px;
}
.child-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-column: 2 / span 2;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
}
```
- The `subgrid` keyword tells the child grid to use the parent's column (or row) tracks.

**Example: Aligning Nested Content**
```html
<!-- preview: true -->
<div class="parent-grid">
  <div>Sidebar</div>
  <div class="child-grid">
    <div>Header</div>
    <div>Main Content</div>
  </div>
  <div>Extra</div>
</div>
<style>
.parent-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  gap: 16px;
}
.child-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-column: 2 / span 2;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  gap: 8px;
}
.child-grid > * {
  background: #e0f7fa;
  padding: 8px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
</style>
```

## CSS Layers (`@layer`)

Cascade Layers allow you to organize your CSS into layers, controlling the order in which rules are applied. This helps manage specificity and makes large codebases more maintainable.

- **Syntax:**
```css
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

@layer base {
  body { font-family: system-ui, sans-serif; }
}
@layer components {
  .button { padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; }
}
@layer utilities {
  .text-center { text-align: center; }
}
```
- Layers declared earlier have lower priority than those declared later.
- You can import layers from other files, making it easier to manage design systems.

## Anchor Positioning (Preview)

Anchor positioning is a new feature that allows you to position elements relative to any anchor, not just their parent or the viewport. This is especially useful for tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns.

- **Syntax:**
```css
.tooltip {
  position-anchor: --anchor;
  anchor-name: --anchor;
  anchor-default: top;
}
```
- This feature is still experimental, but it's set to revolutionize how we build overlays and floating UI elements.
